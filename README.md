## Sentimental Analysis using Naive Bayes Classification.
[Sentiment analysis](https://monkeylearn.com/sentiment-analysis/) is the automated process of determining whether a text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral opinion about a product or topic. By using sentiment analysis, companies don’t have to spend endless hours tagging customer data such as survey responses, reviews, support tickets, and social media comments.

Here, we are doing a sentimental analysis on the Stanford movie reviews dataset using the Gaussian Naive Bayes Classification.


## Requirements
